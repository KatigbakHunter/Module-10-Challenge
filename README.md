# Module-10-Challenge

Overview: The datasets used in this repository are located inside the resources  folder. In the main branch, I have put the python script along with the climate_started.ipynb. The sql queries are also located in the resources folder. Resources I used to help me write code are Instructor Drew's speed runs and recorded class sessions. I also used W3Schools Matplotlib Tutorial as a reference to write the code and for better understanding.
